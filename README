This repository adds patches not in the Debian Squeeze version of libvirt.

Run the build-package script to build the patched packages. No special
privileges are required.

The build-package script attempts to patch the version of libvirt in whatever
repository your apt sources file is pointing at. You should build the package
from an environment where the apt sources file is pointing to Debian's repos.

After running the build-package script the patched packages and archive
containing the debian config and source code can be found in the build
directory.

Tested on:
  0.8.3-5+squeeze2
